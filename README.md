# Mission Statement
- Enhance Accessibility: Make the buying and selling of used cars accessible to a wide audience, regardless of their location or technical expertise.
- Promote Transparency: Foster a transparent marketplace where car conditions, prices, and seller information are clearly presented to ensure informed purchasing decisions.
- Support Fair Pricing: Implement features like price comparisons and bidding systems to encourage fair market values and competitive pricing.
- Encourage Informed Choices: Offer comprehensive car listings with detailed descriptions and history to help users make well-informed choices.
- Streamline Transactions: Provide a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of listing and finding used cars.

# Business Rules
- Each app user can offer more than one used car product.
- Before selling car products, users must first complete their data, such as name, contact, and domicile location.
- Users offer their products through advertisements that will be displayed by the website.
- This ad contains a title, detailed information about the product offered, and the seller’s contact information.
- Some information that must be written in the ad is as follows
    - car brand: Toyota, Daihatsu, Honda, etc.
    - model: Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla Altis, Toyota Vios, Toyota Camry Hybrid, etc.
    - car body type: MPV, SUV, Van, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.
    - car type: manual or automatic
    - year of car manufacture: 2005, 2010, 2011, 2020
    - other descriptions, such as color, distance traveled, etc., can be added as needed.
- Each user can search for offered cars based on the seller user’s location, car brand, and car body type.
- If a potential buyer is interested in a car, he/she can bid on the price of the product if the seller allows the bidding feature.
- The purchase transaction is done outside the application so it is not within the scope of the project.

# Design Requirements
- Use Crow’s Foot Notation.
- Specify the primary key fields in each table by specifying PK beside the fields.
- Draw a line between the fields of each table to show the relationships between each table. This line should be pointed directly to the fields in each table that are used to form the relationship.
- Specify which table is on the one side of the relationship by placing a one next to the field where the line starts.
- Specify which table is on the many side of the relationship by placing a crow’s feet symbol next to the field where the line ends
